**ETL Pipeline for OpenWeatherMap Data Using Airflow and AWS**

• Designed and implemented a robust ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow on AWS EC2 to automate weather
data ingestion from the OpenWeatherMap API, enabling real-time data analysis for weather forecasting.

• Developed custom DAGs within Apache Airflow to optimize task scheduling and manage dependencies, ensuring
efficient pipeline execution and minimal data latency across the ETL process.

• Utilized Python libraries such as Requests and Pandas to extract, clean, and transform API data, improving
data accuracy and facilitating insights generation.

• Ensured data integrity by implementing quality checks before loading into Amazon S3, streamlining storage
for scalable analytics.
